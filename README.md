## Getting Started

Here is our take on the famous Facebook programming assessment – the Coin Change problem

    • A car park has a payment machine that accepts only cash – notes and coins
  
    • It’s a max stay 24-hour car park, so cars cannot stay longer than this duration or they get towed!

    • It costs £3.00 for the first hour, and then 1p for every extra min stayed.

    • Coins are 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p and £1; Notes can be £5, £10, and £20

Write code in any language to take inputs: Time in, Time Out; Output Cost, then ask for Payment in
and the calculate Output Change in the least amount of coins/notes for change

## Test Examples:

Time in:        9:06\
Time Out:       10:17\
Payment In:     £5\
Output Cost:    £3.11\
Output Change : £1, 50p, 20p, 10p, 5p, 2p, 2p\
